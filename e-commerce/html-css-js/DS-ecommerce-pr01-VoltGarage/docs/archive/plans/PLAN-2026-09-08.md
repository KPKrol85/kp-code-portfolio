# Volt Garage — Development Plan

**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-06

**Project type:** Static Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript multi-page storefront demo, built and previewed with Vite 8, published as static output to Netlify

**Plan status:** Active

## Planning principles

- This plan reflects the current verified repository state and the findings recorded in `daily-AUDIT.md` (2026-09-06), each re-verified against the current source before inclusion.
- Main items are checked only after all required subtasks and the stated completion condition are satisfied.
- Canonical HTML, `src/partials/`, CSS, JavaScript, `public/` resources, and build scripts are changed at source; `dist/` and the generated `dist/sw.js` are regenerated and never edited manually.
- Significant completed changes are recorded in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`; no completed plan items are reconstructed here, because the previous pre-Vite plan was removed together with the pre-Vite audit and contained no completed items.
- Browser, Service Worker, Netlify delivery, and Netlify Forms behavior is claimed only after the relevant verification is actually run.
- The project is a demonstrational front-end with no commerce backend, accounts, payments, or order persistence. Work is planned against that documented scope, not against a full commerce platform.

## Current priorities

1. `PH1-01` — Repair and validate the product image contract.
2. `PH1-02` — Resolve runtime structured-data URLs against the current document.
3. `PH1-03` — Make the fallback documents recoverable from any URL.
4. `PH2-01` — Correct the shared phone validation pattern.
5. `PH3-01` — Settle one Service Worker update contract.

## Phase 1 — Runtime link and asset integrity

**Goal:** Every reference the application produces at runtime, and every link in a document served at an arbitrary URL, resolves to real content.

- [x] **PH1-01 — Repair and validate the product image contract** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] correct the `interior-mat` entry in `public/data/products.json` so its `image` value points at the raster that exists (`wnetrze-02.png`)
  - [x] add product-data asset checking to the `scripts/` validators — extended into an existing validator, or as a new `scripts/validate-product-assets.mjs` — asserting that every `image` path and every `_optimized` variant derived from `imageBase` resolves to a file
  - [x] wire the check into the `qa` script in `package.json` without weakening the existing members
  - [x] confirm the corrected reference in the cart `<img>` built by `js/features/cart.js`, and in the `Product` and `ItemList` image URLs built from the same field
  - **Completion condition:** every asset path declared in the catalog resolves in source, and a missing declared asset fails `npm run qa`.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P1-01, and the product-data half of "Extend validation to product-data asset paths and runtime-generated URLs"

- [x] **PH1-02 — Resolve runtime structured-data URLs against the current document** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] change the resolution base in `toAbsolute` (`js/ui/structured-data.js`) from `window.location.origin` to the current document URL, so relative hrefs keep their directory
  - [x] verify the resulting `ItemList` item URLs on `pages/shop.html`, `pages/new-arrivals.html`, and `pages/promotions.html`, where `getProductLink()` returns `product.html?id=…` and the deployed route is `/pages/product.html?id=…`
  - [x] confirm that breadcrumb and image URLs, which currently resolve correctly only because their `../` prefix collapses at the root, remain correct under the new base
  - **Completion condition:** every URL injected into runtime JSON-LD from a `pages/` document resolves to the route that document actually links to.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P1-02

- [x] **PH1-03 — Make the fallback documents recoverable from any URL** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] give `404.html` and `offline.html` root-absolute link targets, consistent with their already root-absolute CSS, font, icon, and manifest references
  - [x] cover the links these documents inherit from `src/partials/header.html` and `src/partials/footer.html`, which render document-relative because `rootPrefix` and `pagesPrefix` are computed from document depth in `scripts/html.mjs`
  - [x] make the primary action in `offline.html` re-request the failed navigation instead of linking to `offline.html` itself
  - [x] verify against a path below the root — the catch-all in `public/_redirects` serves `404.html` at any unmatched path, and `src/sw.js` returns the offline document while the browser keeps the requested URL
  - **Completion condition:** from a miss such as `/pages/typo.html`, every navigation control on both fallback documents leads to the intended page, and the offline retry re-attempts the original request.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P1-03, P2-07

## Phase 2 — Public form contracts

**Goal:** Every public form accepts the formats the site itself prints, and reports only the outcome it actually performs.

- [x] **PH2-01 — Correct the shared phone validation pattern** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] fix the doubled backslash in the `tel` pattern in `pages/contact.html` and `pages/checkout.html`, so the character class matches whitespace rather than a literal backslash and the letter `s`
  - [x] keep the two occurrences derived from one definition so they cannot drift; `js/main.js` sets `form.noValidate` and re-tests the same attribute with `new RegExp(field.pattern)`
  - [x] give the rejection message enough formatting guidance to be actionable
  - [x] verify that the formats the project prints in its own footer and contact page pass both the attribute and the JavaScript layer
  - **Completion condition:** the required phone field accepts the space-separated and prefixed formats the project publishes, and both validation layers agree.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P1-04

- [x] **PH2-02 — Give the homepage newsletter control an honest outcome** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] decide the outcome for the newsletter section in `index.html`: route it through the same validated, demonstration-only flow the checkout uses, or remove the email-entry and submit affordance so nothing implies an address is registered
  - [x] if the validated flow is chosen, add the form hook `js/main.js` binds, a `name` attribute on the required email input, and a status region consistent with the other forms
  - [x] keep the wording inside the documented project scope — the repository contains no subscription destination, and introducing one is a separate product decision outside the current scope
  - [x] verify that submitting no longer performs a default GET that reloads the homepage and discards the address
  - **Completion condition:** the rendered section performs exactly one verified outcome and never falls through to a meaningless default form navigation.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P1-05

- [x] **PH2-03 — Guard checkout submission on a non-empty cart** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] block the checkout success path in `js/main.js` when the stored cart is empty, and report that state in the form status region
  - [x] word the confirmation so it does not claim more than the simulated flow performs, matching how `README.md` already describes checkout
  - [x] verify with an empty cart, where `initCheckoutSummary` in `js/features/cart.js` renders `0 zł` across all three summary lines
  - **Completion condition:** a valid submission with nothing in the cart is refused with a clear message, and the accepted-submission message states only what the demonstration performs.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-06

## Phase 3 — Service Worker update contract

**Goal:** The worker, the update prompt, and the documentation describe one update-activation behavior.

- [x] **PH3-01 — Settle one Service Worker update contract** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] choose one contract: either remove `self.skipWaiting()` from the `install` handler in `src/sw.js` so the update prompt controls activation, or remove the prompt path and keep immediate activation
  - [x] align `js/ui/pwa-prompts.js` with the choice — its update toast posts `SKIP_WAITING` to `registration.waiting`, which cannot exist while the worker skips waiting during install
  - [x] guard the `controllerchange` reload against the first-install transition, where the controller changes from none to the worker claimed in `activate`
  - [x] update the PWA passages in `README.md` and the Service Worker notes in `docs/settings.md` to describe the contract that ends up implemented
  - [x] verify update and first-install behavior against a production build served through `npm run preview`, since registration is disabled in dev
  - **Completion condition:** one update contract is implemented in the worker, the prompt, and the documentation, and no page reload occurs without user action.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P1-06

## Phase 4 — Shared shell correctness and interaction quality

**Goal:** The shared header and footer, and the catalog controls, describe their destinations and state correctly across all 15 documents.

- [x] **PH4-01 — Align shared navigation labels with their destinations** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] resolve the "Dostawa" and "Zwroty" entries in `src/partials/header.html` and `src/partials/footer.html`, which currently link to `checkout.html` and `cart.html`
  - [x] either point them at content that answers them or remove them until such content exists; adding a route also requires updating `public/sitemap.xml`, manifest shortcuts, and the smoke scope where relevant
  - [x] run `npm run qa:links` after the change
  - **Completion condition:** no shared navigation entry names a topic its destination does not contain.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-01

- [x] **PH4-02 — Repair the document heading outline** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] align the four footer column headings in `src/partials/footer.html` with the level the surrounding page outline actually reaches, instead of a fixed `<h4>`
  - [x] resolve the two in-page skips where an `<h3>` precedes any `<h2>`: the hero card in `index.html` and the summary panel in `pages/cart.html`
  - [x] re-scan heading levels across all 15 rendered documents, including `404.html`, `offline.html`, `thank-you.html`, and `pages/collections.html`, where the current jump is `h1` to `h4`
  - **Completion condition:** no rendered document skips a heading level between its own outline and the shared footer.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-02

- [x] **PH4-03 — Give the theme toggle a stable accessible name** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] stop overwriting the toggle's `aria-label` with the theme value in `reflectPreference` (`js/ui/theme.js`) and give the control a persistent descriptive name in `src/partials/header.html`
  - [x] let `aria-pressed` carry the state, and reconsider `aria-live="polite"` on the interactive control itself
  - [x] verify the announced name and pressed state after toggling in both directions
  - **Completion condition:** the control is announced by what it does rather than by the current theme value, on every page.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-03

- [x] **PH4-04 — Keep the add-to-cart button label restorable** — **Priority:** Low
  - [x] in `initAddToCartButtons` (`js/features/cart.js`), capture the original label once per button or reset the pending timeout on each click, so a second click inside the 1200 ms window cannot capture the confirmation text
  - [x] verify by activating one card's button twice in quick succession and confirming the label and accessible name return to the original
  - **Completion condition:** repeated activation never leaves the button permanently showing the confirmation label.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-04

## Phase 5 — Public content and catalog consistency

**Goal:** Public content matches the catalog and the filters it sends visitors to.

- [x] **PH5-01 — Resolve the Detailing category** — **Priority:** Low
  - [x] decide whether Detailing becomes a real category in `public/data/products.json` and in `#filter-category` in `pages/shop.html`, or is presented as part of Gadżety
  - [x] apply the decision to the Detailing card in `pages/collections.html`, which currently links to the same filtered result as the Gadżety card
  - [x] apply the same decision to the non-interactive Detailing pill in `index.html`
  - **Completion condition:** every category presented to visitors exists in the catalog and in the shop filter, and no two collection cards resolve to the same filtered result.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-05

- [x] **PH5-02 — Remove the duplicated hero statistic** — **Priority:** Low
  - [x] replace the repeated figure and label in the first two `.stat` blocks of the `index.html` hero card with the intended second statistic, or reduce the grid to three items
  - **Completion condition:** the homepage hero stats grid shows no duplicated figure.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-08

## Phase 6 — Repository and documentation contracts

**Goal:** The published package and the documents describing it match the current repository inventory.

- [x] **PH6-01 — Remove unreferenced and duplicated published assets** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] remove the two accidentally committed shortcut directories under `public/assets/icons/shortcuts/` after confirming `public/site.webmanifest` uses only the three canonical files directly under `shortcuts/`
  - [x] remove the unreferenced hero sets `hero-01` through `hero-04` from both `public/assets/images/hero/` and `public/assets/images/_optimized/hero/`; only `hero-05` is referenced, from `index.html`
  - [x] remove the remaining unreferenced files — `public/assets/images/og/og-1200x1200.jpg`, `public/assets/icons/favicon/favicon-96x96.png`, the `_optimized/products/zewnetrze-02` pair whose name sits one character from the real `zewnetrzne-02` variants, and the six unused SVGs directly under `public/assets/images/` — or record in `docs/settings.md` why each is retained
  - [x] run `npm run build` afterwards so `scripts/validate-package.mjs` confirms the manifest icon, shortcut, and screenshot paths still resolve
  - **Completion condition:** every file copied from `public/` into `dist/` is either referenced by the project or documented as intentionally retained.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-09

- [x] **PH6-02 — Remove the stale `humans.txt` references** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] remove the four `humans.txt` passages in `README.md` and the one in `docs/settings.md` that still describe it as a tracked `public/` file and as part of `dist/`
  - [x] drop the leftover `humans.txt` entry from the public-file fixture in `scripts/tests/build-contract.test.mjs`
  - [x] run `npm run qa:build` to confirm the package-contract tests still pass
  - **Completion condition:** no tracked file describes `humans.txt` as part of the repository or the deployment package.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-10

- [x] **PH6-03 — Remove leftover development artifacts from the product module** — **Priority:** Low
  - [x] delete the two `CHANGED: img -> picture` comments in the card templates of `js/features/products.js`, which are emitted into the DOM of every rendered product card
  - [x] remove the exported but unimported `initShopProducts`, whose work `initFilters` already performs for `[data-products="shop"]`, so no duplicate shop-rendering path remains
  - [x] run `npm run qa:js` after the change
  - **Completion condition:** production markup carries no editing notes, and only one shop-rendering path exists.
  - **Source:** `daily-AUDIT.md` — P2-11

## Optional future improvements

- [x] **O-01 — Extend validation to runtime-generated item URLs**
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-02`
  - **Value:** `scripts/validate-jsonld.js` asserts schema types and a source regex only, so it could not detect the `ItemList` URL defect; a check over runtime-generated URLs would keep catching it as pages are added.
  - **Scope boundary:** an addition to the existing validators using tooling already present in the repository; non-blocking, and not a change to the QA workflow shape.
  - **Completed:** `scripts/tests/structured-data-urls.test.mjs` now exercises the shop, new-arrivals, and promotions initializers and inspects the JSON-LD written by `injectItemListJsonLd()`, asserting absolute `/pages/product.html?id=…` item URLs consistent with the product-link helper and rendered cards. Removing URL absolutization from either runtime mapping fails the new test. Verification: focused tests 6/6, `qa:build` 115/115, `validate:jsonld`, and `qa:js` passed; the existing QA workflow is unchanged.

- [x] **O-02 — Harden cart state deserialization against malformed stored values**
  - **Value:** `getCart` in `js/features/cart.js` recovers from `JSON.parse` failures but returns whatever parsed successfully; a non-array value would then throw in `cart.find` and `cart.reduce` on every page that renders the cart badge.
  - **Scope boundary:** resilience for an edge case the project does not currently produce itself; not a defect in the present implementation.
  - **Completed:** `getCart` in `js/features/cart.js` now guards the parsed value with `Array.isArray`, so any successfully parsed non-array is treated as an empty cart while valid arrays pass through unchanged; malformed state is left in storage for the existing `saveCart` flow to overwrite, and the `cart:parse` logging on genuine `JSON.parse` failures is untouched. `scripts/tests/cart-storage-state.test.mjs` exercises `initCart`, `hasCartItems`, and `addToCart` against stored `{}`, a populated object, `"hello"`, `123`, `true`, and `null`, asserting a `"0"` badge, no reported cart contents, and recovery into `[{ id, qty: 1 }]`, alongside the preserved behaviour for missing storage, invalid JSON, `[]`, and populated carts. Reverting the guard fails 16 of its 32 assertions. Verification: focused tests 32/32, `qa:build` 147/147, and `qa:js` passed; the QA workflow shape is unchanged.

- [x] **O-03 — Add a no-JavaScript dark-theme fallback in CSS**
  - **Value:** `css/partials/themes.css` defines palettes only under `:root` and the `data-theme` attributes, while every document declares `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">`; a `prefers-color-scheme` block would align the two for visitors without JavaScript.
  - **Scope boundary:** a refinement to the intentional JS-first theming model, not a correction to it.
  - **Completed:** `css/partials/themes.css` now closes with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root:not([data-theme]) { … } }`, repeating the nineteen `[data-theme='dark']` declarations verbatim, so a visitor whose system prefers dark receives the dark palette even when the preload script and `js/ui/theme.js` never run. The `:not([data-theme])` guard stops the rule matching the moment the runtime writes `data-theme`, leaving an explicit `light` choice authoritative under a dark system and an explicit `dark` choice authoritative under a light one; no JavaScript, HTML, storage, or theme-token architecture changed. `scripts/tests/theme-css-fallback.test.mjs` parses the stylesheet into rules and declarations and asserts the single `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block, its lone `:root:not([data-theme])` selector, that no dark media query anywhere under `css/` reaches `:root` or `html` unguarded, that both explicit palettes stay outside any media query, and that the fallback declarations equal the `[data-theme='dark']` set name for name and value for value. Removing the block, widening the selector to `:root` or to `html`, drifting a single token, and repeating the light palette fail 4, 4, 4, 1, and 2 of its assertions respectively. Verification: focused tests 6/6, `qa:build` 153/153, `qa:css`, and `qa:js` passed; the QA workflow shape is unchanged.

- [x] **O-04 — Reduce the shipped raster payload for product fallbacks**
  - **Value:** before O-04, the 12 catalog raster fallbacks totalled 19,591,726 bytes (18.684126 MiB), including 18,887,522 bytes of PNG and 704,204 bytes of JPG. Existing product AVIF/WebP variants total 747,507 / 1,150,238 bytes. These are package sizes; runtime network savings have not been measured.
  - **Scope boundary:** the retained source files are a deliberate part of the `tools/image-optimizer/` pipeline; variant generation itself is unaffected.
  - **Completed:** scratch benchmarks with Sharp 0.33.5 justified re-encoding all nine PNGs with `compressionLevel: 9`, `adaptiveFiltering: true`, and `palette: false`; filtering disabled increased size. PNGs now total 17,467,782 bytes, saving 1,419,740 bytes (1.353970 MiB; 7.516815%). Every decoded RGB/RGBA buffer matches exactly; dimensions, transparency, orientation, and color rendering are preserved. Re-encoding removes 512,327 bytes of C2PA `caBX` provenance metadata and adds 189 bytes of square-pixel `pHYs` metadata. JPGs, catalog references, rendering code, optimizer behavior, and all 24 existing AVIF/WebP variants remain unchanged; identical source pixels require no variant rewrites. Fresh packages measured 27,181,257 -> 25,761,517 bytes; final raster bytes are 18,171,986 in both `public/` and `dist/`. Verification passed: `qa:product-assets`, focused product/inventory tests 11/11, `qa:build` 153/153, `build` with automatic package validation (15 HTML entries / 71 public files), all 24 derived variant paths, optimizer product dry-run (12 sources, no warnings/errors or writes), and `git diff --check`. No new tooling, dependencies, size budgets, or runtime network-saving claims.

- [x] **O-05 — Replace the inline-script allowance in the CSP with per-script hashes**
  - **Value:** `public/_headers` now retains `script-src 'self'` and authorizes the shared inline theme preload with `'sha256-m/3FUg3Lcv10P/YC56yy2U6+bV9StrN+MZc2jiNO0oU='`; the broad script allowance is removed.
  - **Scope boundary:** optional hardening of the deliberate static-host trade-off; `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` and all other CSP directives are unchanged. Theme behavior and static/runtime structured data are preserved.
  - **Completed:** inventory through the canonical renderer found 15 identical executable theme preloads and two static `application/ld+json` blocks (`OnlineStore`, `WebSite`, homepage only), with no inline handlers, `javascript:` URLs, or `srcdoc`. Production HTML now emits LF before hashing/build identity generation: Chromium parses CRLF as LF, so hashing the original CRLF bytes blocked the preload. The validator hashes exact final script text without normalization, checks the shipped global CSP and every production HTML file, and rejects unapproved/mismatched scripts, unsafe permissions, overrides, execution attributes/URLs, and orphaned hashes. It reuses the existing HTML parser without adding dependencies.
  - **Verification:** focused CSP/build-contract tests 36/36, `qa:build` 185/185, `qa:js`, `qa:html`, `validate:jsonld` (15 entries, two template assertions), `build` with automatic package validation, separate `qa:package` (15 HTML entries / 71 public files), focused Prettier with CRLF, and `git diff --check` passed. A one-byte space insertion in the actual homepage preload failed the build on its missing matching hash; byte-for-byte source restoration and a fresh build passed. Chromium 147.0.7727.15 on local Vite preview, with the exact `dist/_headers` CSP enforced as a response header, passed six scenarios across homepage/shop/product: preload before the held application bundle, stored light/dark and system fallback, theme toggle/ARIA/storage, cart actions, static JSON-LD, and runtime `BreadcrumbList`/`ItemList`/`Product`. Legitimate execution had zero CSP violations/page errors; an injected unapproved inline script was blocked. Inert JSON-LD remained valid and present without hashes. Production preload bytes matched browser text exactly (512 bytes). No Netlify deployment, other-browser, or service-worker cache verification was performed; browser contexts blocked service workers to isolate the response-header test.

## Verification limits for this review

- The worktree was inspected statically and only `PLAN.md` was created; no application source, configuration, documentation, or generated output was changed.
- `node_modules/` is absent in this worktree, so no project QA, build, formatter, Lighthouse, browser, assistive-technology, or deployment check was run while producing this plan. Every item derives from source inspection plus findings in `daily-AUDIT.md` re-verified against the current files.
- `dist/` does not exist, so the production package, Service Worker runtime behavior, Netlify headers and redirects, and Netlify Forms delivery are assessed from their source contracts only.
