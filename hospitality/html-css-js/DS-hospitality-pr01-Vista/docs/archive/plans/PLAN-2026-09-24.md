# Vista — Development Plan

**Source:** `AUDIT.md` — Final Technical Front-End Audit, 2026-09-23
**Project:** Demonstrational static multi-page site (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript)
**Status:** Active; PH1-01 complete, three objectives open

Root HTML, `css/`, `js/`, and `assets/seo/` are canonical sources. Production bundles and `dist/` are generated. Complete an objective only after its implementation and focused verification meet the stated condition. The archived plan and review document completed work; they do not add work to this cycle.

## Current priorities

1. `PH1-01` — Fix closed mobile navigation keyboard access (complete).
2. `PH1-02` — Enforce arrival-date validity; resolve the no-JavaScript submission mechanism before claiming full completion.
3. `PH1-03` — Align indexable hotel claims with the demonstrational project, after the owner identifies which contact details should remain public and how.
4. `PH2-01` — Update both README accessibility descriptions after `PH1-02`, so the form statement reflects the implemented behavior.

The three Phase 1 objectives have no code dependency on one another. The owner decision gates the content choices in `PH1-03`; `PH2-01` depends on the final form behavior in `PH1-02`.

## Phase 1 — Release-relevant corrections

**Goal:** Resolve the three current P1 findings without changing the source-to-`dist/` workflow.

- [x] **PH1-01 — Remove closed mobile navigation from keyboard order**
  - [x] Make the JavaScript-controlled mobile menu non-rendered and non-focusable when closed, including on initial load; keep its open state and desktop menu visible.
  - [x] Preserve toggle, Escape, link-selection and focus-return behavior, plus the visible no-JavaScript navigation.
  - [x] In a browser at mobile width, traverse with Tab and Shift+Tab before opening, while open, and after closing with the toggle and Escape; check first-link focus, focus return, desktop navigation, and navigation with JavaScript disabled. Repeat the relevant checks in a fresh package built from source.
  - **Verification:** Local Chromium at 390 px passed initial closed display and keyboard traversal, open first-link focus and seven-link traversal, toggle/Escape/link closing with focus return, and no-JavaScript visibility and keyboard access. At 1280 px the desktop navigation remained visible and focusable; resizing back to mobile restored the closed state. The same checks passed on root source and freshly built `dist/` (`npm run build:dist`, 11 HTML pages).
  - **Completion condition:** Closed mobile links never enter sequential keyboard focus; opening exposes and focuses the menu, closing restores usable focus, and desktop and no-JavaScript navigation remain usable.
  - **Sources:** `css/modules/layout.css`, `js/features/nav.js`, root-page header markup (for example `index.html`). **Audit:** `AUDIT.md` P1-01.

- [x] **PH1-02 — Reject past arrival dates on inquiry submission**
  - [x] Validate arrival against the refreshed current local date in the enhanced submit path before `form.submit()`, including dates entered directly; retain the date-field relationship, accessible errors, and Netlify Forms identity and submission path.
  - [x] Preserve native form constraints when JavaScript is absent or initialization fails. Static HTML has no moving arrival minimum; the submission-side gate must cover this path.
  - [x] Production verification confirmed by the project owner: the Netlify deployment contained the Edge Function; a POST to the deployed contact form with arrival `2025-01-01` returned HTTP 422; a valid inquiry reached Netlify and displayed "Thank you! Your form submission has been received." Separate inspection of the inquiry in the Netlify Forms dashboard was not documented. The gate uses the Europe/Warsaw date; this can differ from the visitor's local date used by enhanced validation.
  - [x] Focused local Chromium checks passed on source and fresh `dist/`: enhanced past/direct-entry past, equal/earlier departure, missing arrival, stale-date, and other invalid-field cases were blocked; today/future requests reached a local POST interceptor with `form-name=booking`, including with Netlify's stripped attribute simulated. Native `ValidityState` checks passed for required fields, email, phone pattern, guest range/step, and consent; constraints remained active after simulated form initialization failure. With JavaScript disabled, completed past and future forms both POSTed locally as expected without the Edge gate. The Edge handler's local request checks passed; production results are recorded above.
  - **Completion condition:** A completed past-arrival inquiry is rejected in both enhanced and no-JavaScript submission paths by verified mechanisms; a valid future-date inquiry retains the Netlify Forms route and existing native baseline. If no no-JavaScript submission-side check is adopted, this condition remains unmet.
  - **Sources:** `contact.html`, `js/features/form.js`; Netlify Forms configuration in the form markup. **Audit:** `AUDIT.md` P1-02.

- [x] **PH1-03 — Make indexable hotel claims consistent with the fictional brand**
  - [x] Apply the owner's confirmation that the published address, telephone and email are real author contact details: preserve them and the map, label the contact-page block and all 11 shared footer contact sections as belonging to KP_Code Digital Studio, and retain Vista as the fictional hospitality brand.
  - [x] Align the embedded JSON-LD fallbacks and their fetched counterparts on the six indexable pages, removing unsupported `Hotel`, location and customer-service claims and references to `#hotel` while retaining valid `WebSite`, page and image structure and unrelated metadata.
  - [x] Align affected titles, descriptions and visible contact/location claims with the demonstrational disclosure in `regulamin.html`. Clarify the real author contacts, illustrative accommodation offers, map presentation and inquiry form's project-communication purpose. Preserve canonical URLs, indexing controls and unrelated SEO fields.
  - [x] Parse and compare all six embedded/fetched JSON-LD pairs in source and a fresh package; confirm semantic equality, preserved entity types and identifiers, and no dangling references or structured hotel/location/contact claims. Compare visible contact values, form controls and map URLs against the original source: unchanged.
  - **Verification (2026-09-24):** `npm run build:dist` passed CSS/JS verification and generated 11 HTML pages; esbuild required a retry outside the sandbox after an access-denied failure. Fresh `dist/` JSON-LD matches source. Local Chrome 153 passed all six pages with successful JSON fetching, failed fetching and JavaScript disabled on source and `dist/`. All 11 footers and the contact attribution passed 390/1280 px light/dark checks for visibility, readable contrast and no horizontal overflow; contact/footer screenshots were inspected. The no-JavaScript map fallback and simulated iframe-load enhancement passed; valid enhanced inquiries reached a local POST interceptor with `form-name=booking`. JavaScript, Netlify Forms controls, arrival validation, Edge Function and service-worker sources are unchanged. `git diff --check` passed.
  - **Limits:** Local checks do not establish live Google Maps rendering, Netlify delivery/collection or search-engine behavior. No deployment or unrelated regression suites were run. The build reported an outdated Browserslist dataset; no dependencies were installed or updated.
  - **Completion condition:** All affected indexable page and JSON-LD claims agree that Vista is a fictional demonstration, without unsupported hotel identity, location or service contacts; retained contact details follow the owner's decision and the structured data remains valid.
  - **Sources:** `index.html`, `rooms.html`, `offers.html`, `gallery.html`, `onas.html`, `contact.html`; corresponding `assets/seo/ld-{index,rooms,offers,gallery,onas,contact}.json`; `regulamin.html`; shared footer contact markup in all root HTML pages; `css/modules/layout.css`, `css/modules/subpages.css`, `assets/img/ui/map-fallback.svg`. Inspected `js/features/seo-jsonld.js` for fallback replacement; no module change was needed. **Audit:** `AUDIT.md` P1-03.

## Phase 2 — Documentation alignment

**Goal:** Make the public accessibility description match the corrected behavior.

- [x] **PH2-01 — Correct bilingual README accessibility statements**
  - [x] Update only the Polish and English accessibility descriptions of reveal content and form validation: content is visible before successful reveal enhancement, and native constraints remain active without JavaScript while the enhanced handler controls validation after initialization.
  - [x] After `PH1-02`, describe the verified arrival-date behavior and any remaining no-JavaScript limit accurately, with Polish and English factual parity; preserve unrelated README content.
  - [x] Compare both descriptions against `css/modules/utilities.css`, `js/features/reveal.js`, `contact.html`, `js/features/form.js`, and the focused form verification from `PH1-02`.
  - **Verification (2026-09-24):** Focused source inspection, including `netlify/edge-functions/validate-booking-date.js`, and comparison with the recorded `PH1-02` checks confirmed Polish/English factual parity: visible reveal fallback, enhancement-only animations, native constraints before successful form initialization, accessible enhanced validation against the refreshed browser-local date, and Edge rejection of invalid/past arrival dates using Europe/Warsaw, including no-JavaScript requests. Both descriptions distinguish inquiries from reservations and preserve the WCAG disclaimer. Unrelated README content and all other plan sections are unchanged.
  - **Limits:** Static HTML has no moving arrival minimum; the browser-local and Europe/Warsaw dates can differ. The existing `PH1-02` record documents local verification and still marks live Netlify processing/collection as unverified; this documentation update adds no delivery claim. No tests, build or deployment were run.
  - **Completion condition:** Both language sections accurately state the current reveal and form-validation behavior, including any verified limit, without claiming accessibility conformance or unverified form delivery.
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-02` final behavior. **Sources:** `README.md` and the cited source files. **Audit:** `AUDIT.md` P2-01.
