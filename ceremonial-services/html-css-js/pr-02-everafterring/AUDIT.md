# EverAfter Ring — Final Technical Front-End Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-08-13
**Status re-verified:** 2026-08-13, against the current source and Git history
**Project type:** Static multi-page website in Polish (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript ES modules) with a Node-based production build into `dist/`; no runtime dependencies, no backend
**Audit mode:** Final repository and implementation review
**Active findings:** 0 — no P0, no open P1, no open P2

## 1. Executive assessment

The repository is coherent and well-maintained. Architecture boundaries are explicit: `css/main.css` is the single stylesheet entry point, `js/app.js` is the single application entry point with a fixed module order, `partials/` holds the only copy of the shared shell, and `scripts/build.mjs` owns the production output. Documentation is unusually accurate: `README.md` describes the delivered mechanisms rather than aspirations, and the legal pages describe the two `localStorage` entries, the Netlify Forms submission path, and the embedded Google Maps frame that the code actually implements.

The risk this audit identified was concentrated in client-side interaction state rather than in structure, content, or tooling, alongside two build- and repository-workflow items. All of those findings have since been delivered; the completed changes are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` and their tasks in `PLAN.md`. No finding remains open here.

## 2. Audit scope and verification

### Areas inspected

- All 10 top-level HTML pages: `index.html`, `oferta.html`, `uslugi.html`, `realizacje.html`, `o-nas.html`, `kontakt.html`, `dziekujemy.html`, `polityka-prywatnosci.html`, `regulamin.html`, `cookies.html`
- Shared shell: `partials/header.html`, `partials/footer.html`
- Full CSS tree: `css/main.css`, `css/tokens.css`, `css/fonts.css`, `css/base.css`, `css/layout.css`, all files under `css/components/` and `css/sections/`
- Full JavaScript tree: `js/app.js`, `js/config.js`, `js/utils.js`, `js/theme-bootstrap.js`, all modules under `js/modules/`
- Build and asset tooling: `scripts/build.mjs`, `scripts/optimize-images.mjs`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `start-local-preview.bat`, `.codex/environments/environment.toml`
- Metadata and delivery contract: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `assets/favicon/site.webmanifest`, per-page `<head>` metadata and JSON-LD, `.gitignore`
- Documentation and licensing: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`
- Repository state: current Git branch, status, and diff

### Verification performed

- `node --check` on all 14 `.js`/`.mjs` files — executed and passed
- JSON parse of `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `assets/favicon/site.webmanifest` and all 20 JSON-LD blocks; XML parse of `sitemap.xml` — executed and passed
- Local reference resolution across all HTML, partials, and CSS (`src`, `href`, `srcset`, `url()`), resolving partial paths against the root as the runtime and build both do — executed, 322 references checked, 0 missing
- Duplicate-ID and ARIA/label reference check per page with `partials/header.html` and `partials/footer.html` injected — executed and passed; no duplicates, no dangling references
- `<img>` alternative-text presence check across all pages and partials — executed and passed
- Read-only in-memory simulation of the `build:html` stage contract (partial-host regex match, single-`aria-current` assertion, `.min` asset reference substitution) for all 10 pages — executed, all 10 would pass; no files written
- Contrast computation (WCAG 2.x relative luminance) for deterministic token pairs in both themes, including alpha compositing for the footer and callout — executed
- Image dimension check: all `assets/img-src/` sources and generated variants against the `width`/`height` attributes in markup — executed and passed (hero 1080×720, portfolio 1200×900)
- Generated-variant completeness: `assets/img/hero` (54 files) and `assets/img/portfolio-img` (81 files) match 6 and 9 sources × 3 widths × 3 formats — executed and passed
- Lockfile consistency against `package.json` devDependencies — executed and passed (esbuild 0.28.0, lightningcss 1.32.0, sharp 0.34.5)
- Unreferenced-asset scan across HTML, CSS, JS, manifest, and build scripts — executed and passed; every file under `assets/` outside `img-src/` resolves from source
- `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`debugger`/`console.log` scan of shipped source — executed; none found outside the build scripts' intended CLI output

### Verification limitations

- No browser or assistive-technology verification was performed. Findings about rendered layout, paint order, and focus behaviour are derived from the cascade and script sequence in the source; they are labelled accordingly.
- No deployment URL was supplied for this audit, so no live environment was inspected and no claim is made about whether the project is currently deployed. The origin declared in `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and the per-page canonical/`og:url` metadata is treated as configuration, not as evidence of an active deployment.
- The repository contains no automated test suite, so no test results are reported.
- Contrast was assessed only for deterministic token pairs. Surfaces composed with `color-mix()` over the modal backdrop and the hero gradient overlays were not evaluated.

## 3. Verified strengths

- Single, unambiguous source of truth per concern: `css/main.css` is the only stylesheet entry (`css/main.css:1-16`), `js/app.js` is the only application entry with an explicit module order (`js/app.js:9-16`), and `partials/` holds the only copy of the header, footer, and project notice.
- The build enforces its own contracts instead of assuming them: `scripts/build.mjs:119-133` fails the build if a partial host is missing, and `scripts/build.mjs:105-117` fails it if a primary-navigation page does not end up with exactly one `nav__link` carrying `aria-current="page"`.
- Reference integrity is complete — all 322 local references resolve, with no duplicate IDs and no dangling ARIA or label targets across all 10 pages with partials injected.
- Metadata is consistent across every page: each has its own `title`, `description`, `canonical`, full Open Graph set with image dimensions and alt text, Twitter Card, and two JSON-LD blocks, all parsing cleanly.
- Image delivery is coherent: `<picture>` with AVIF/WebP/JPG, matching `srcset`/`sizes`, explicit `width`/`height` matching the real files, `decoding="async"`, and `loading="lazy"` on below-the-fold images only.
- Defensive initialisation is the norm in the JS modules: `js/modules/nav.js:4-9`, `js/modules/form.js:22-24`, `js/modules/hero.js:1-14`, and `js/modules/header-scroll.js:7-9` all guard on missing elements and on re-initialisation before binding.
- Theme persistence degrades safely: `js/theme-bootstrap.js:10-17` and `js/modules/theme.js:10-25` both wrap storage access so the toggle keeps working for the current page when storage is unavailable.
- Colour tokens hold up under measurement: body text 14.30:1, muted body copy 4.48–5.47:1, accent 7.24:1, primary button 7.73:1, footer text 9.18:1, and the dark theme 8.90–16.24:1 across the pairs checked.
- Legal documentation matches the implementation rather than a template: `cookies.html` lists exactly the two `localStorage` keys the code writes and explicitly states that no service worker, `sessionStorage`, or Cache Storage is used, which is correct for this repository; `polityka-prywatnosci.html` describes the Netlify Forms path and the Google Maps frame that `kontakt.html` actually contains.
- Repository hygiene in shipped source is clean: no `TODO`/`FIXME`/`debugger`/`console.log` outside the build scripts' intended output, and `.gitignore` documents which generated paths are intentionally tracked.
- Asset ownership is complete: every file under `assets/` outside `img-src/` resolves from source, so `scripts/build.mjs:153-166` copies no file the site does not use, and each icon set has exactly one authoritative copy — inline in `partials/header.html` and `partials/footer.html`.

## 7. Extra quality improvements

### Add a custom 404 page

- **Relevant area:** Routing and shared shell.
- **Current evidence:** The repository contains ten pages and no `404.html`; `scripts/build.mjs:12-23` lists every page explicitly, and the shared shell is already available to any new page through the partial hosts.
- **Potential value:** An unknown path would land on a page consistent with the site's own design and navigation instead of the hosting platform's default, using infrastructure that already exists.
- **Scope boundary:** Optional. The current behaviour is not a defect, and hosting configuration is intentionally maintained outside this repository.

### Reflect invalid form state in the accessibility tree

- **Relevant area:** Contact form validation (`js/modules/form.js:30-45`, `kontakt.html:127-190`).
- **Current evidence:** Validation is already well built — `novalidate` applied from script, per-field messages written into `aria-describedby` targets, focus moved to the first invalid field, and an `aria-live="polite"` status region. The one signal not exposed is `aria-invalid` on the fields themselves.
- **Potential value:** Screen readers would announce a field as invalid on entry rather than relying on the description text alone, and the state would be available for styling without an additional class.
- **Scope boundary:** Optional refinement to a working implementation; no change to the validation logic or the Netlify Forms contract is implied.

### Promote the build's existing consistency checks into a standalone check command

- **Relevant area:** Verification tooling (`scripts/build.mjs:105-117`, `scripts/build.mjs:119-133`, `package.json` scripts).
- **Current evidence:** The build already asserts partial-host presence and single-`aria-current` correctness, but those assertions can only run as part of a build that produces `dist/`. The repository has no command that validates the pages without producing output.
- **Potential value:** The same guarantees plus cheap additions such as local-reference resolution could be run routinely and quickly, without writing any files — the checks this audit performed ad hoc would become repeatable.
- **Scope boundary:** Optional. This proposes reusing logic that already exists rather than introducing a test framework or new dependencies.

## 8. Current readiness conclusion

**Status:** No open findings at any priority.

Nothing blocks the project from being built, served, or read: content, structure, metadata, references, asset ownership, and documentation are all in good order. The remaining entries in this document are the optional improvements in section 7, none of which is a defect.

This status is a repository-state assessment. It is not an accessibility certification, a security assessment, a guarantee of browser or assistive-technology behaviour, or a performance measurement — none of which were performed, as recorded in the verification limitations.

## 9. Senior rating

**Rating:** 8/10 — reassessed 2026-08-13 against the current repository state, with every finding now closed (7/10 on the audit date)

**Active findings behind this rating:** P0 — 0. P1 — 0. P2 — 0.

The source-level work this audit called for is complete. The interaction layer establishes its own defaults instead of depending on scripting to repair them: the theme resolved before first paint survives runtime initialisation, the mobile navigation panel is closed in markup and CSS below the breakpoint, the project-notice dialog contains focus and closes on `Escape` and on the backdrop, and no raw hex literal remains anywhere under `css/` outside `css/tokens.css`. Asset ownership is now complete as well — every shipped file resolves from source, and each icon set has one authoritative copy. The build contract is verifiable as documented — `npm run build` writes only into the ignored `dist/` — and `.gitattributes` keeps diffs reviewable.

The rating holds at 8 rather than rising, because the two factors that gate a higher score are unchanged by this cleanup: the repository still has no automated test suite and no output-free check command, so the build's own contract assertions can only run as part of a build; and runtime, browser, and assistive-technology behaviour remain unverified in this document, as recorded in the verification limitations. This is the standard the previous reassessment set — a rating above this range needs observed behaviour and repeatable checks, not further source-level fixes — and closing the last finding was a source-level fix. What lifts it from here is the standalone check command proposed in section 7, plus verification in a real browser — not more changes to the source.
