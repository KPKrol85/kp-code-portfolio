# EverAfter Ring — Development Plan

**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-15
**Project type:** Static multi-page website in Polish (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript ES modules) with a Node-based production build into `dist/`; no runtime dependencies, no backend
**Plan status:** Complete — every required and optional item is delivered

## Planning principles

- The plan reflects the current verified repository state.
- A main item is checked only when all required subtasks are complete and its completion condition is satisfied.
- Canonical sources are `partials/`, `css/main.css` and its imports, `js/app.js` and its modules, and the build configuration in `vite.config.js` with `scripts/html-shell.mjs`; `dist/` is generated output and is never edited directly.
- Completed significant changes are recorded separately in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Findings referenced as `AUDIT.md — P1-xx` / `P2-xx` were re-verified against the current source before being entered here.
- `AUDIT.md` lists only findings that are still open; a `Source:` reference to a finding no longer listed there means the finding is resolved and the change is recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Current status

All required work in Phases 1–4 is complete; no required item remains open, and `AUDIT.md` lists no open `P0`, `P1` or `P2` finding.

`O-01`, `O-02` and `O-03` have since been delivered as well, so no entry in this plan is left unchecked. Further work on the project starts from new items rather than from anything recorded here.

## Phase 1 — Verifiable repository and build baseline

**Goal:** Make working-tree diffs reviewable and make the documented production build runnable without side effects, so every later change can be verified.

- [x] **PH1-01 — Establish a line-ending normalisation policy** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] add a root `.gitattributes` declaring text detection and the normalised committed form (no `.gitattributes` currently exists in the repository)
  - [x] renormalise the index so the eight files that currently differ from `HEAD` only by carriage returns no longer report whole-file diffs (`.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `cookies.html`, `css/components/project-notice.css`, `js/modules/hero.js`, `js/modules/project-notice.js`, `polityka-prywatnosci.html`, `regulamin.html`)
  - [x] resolve the mixed line endings inside `js/modules/hero.js`, which currently contains a single CRLF line among LF lines
  - [x] re-check `git status` and `git diff --stat` after normalisation
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P2-03
  - **Completion condition:** editing one line in a source file produces a one-line diff, and `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat` and `git diff --stat` agree
  - **Note:** `css/components/project-notice.css` and `js/modules/project-notice.js` are also touched by `PH2-03`, so this item runs first to keep that review readable
  - **Delivered:** `054c1c9`. `.gitattributes` declares `* text=auto eol=lf` plus explicit `binary` for `.avif`, `.ico`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.woff2`. `git ls-files --eol` reports `i/lf w/lf` for all eight files and no CRLF or mixed entry anywhere in the repository; `js/modules/hero.js` contains no carriage return; `git status` and `git diff --stat` are both clean, so `git diff --stat` and `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat` agree.

- [x] **PH1-02 — Separate image generation from the deployment build** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] change the `build` script in `package.json` so the deployment build no longer chains `optimize:images`
  - [x] keep `npm run optimize:images` as the explicit step run when sources under `assets/img-src/` change
  - [x] update the build sequence described in `README.md` ("Build produkcyjny" / "Production Build") to match the new script contract
  - [x] run the build once with dependencies installed and confirm it writes only into the ignored `dist/` directory
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P2-05
  - **Completion condition:** `npm run build` completes and `git status` remains clean afterwards
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-01`
  - **Delivered:** `85dc8e2`. `package.json` — `scripts.build` is now `node scripts/build.mjs build`; `optimize:images` is retained as a standalone script. Both language sections of `README.md` describe the five-step build and state that image generation is no longer part of it, replacing the note that the build was never run because it overwrote `assets/img/`. The implementing task ran `npm run build` against the new contract with dependencies installed: it completed, produced `dist/`, did not run image optimisation, and left `assets/img/` and `package-lock.json` untouched, so `git status` stayed clean. `scripts/build.mjs` writes only beneath `distRoot`, and `.gitignore:11` ignores `/dist/`.

## Phase 2 — Interaction-state defects

**Goal:** Correct the four implemented behaviours that do not match the contract the project documents, establishing correct defaults instead of relying on JavaScript to repair them.

- [x] **PH2-01 — Resolve theme fallback in one shared place** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] remove the duplicated resolution: `js/theme-bootstrap.js` resolves stored value → `prefers-color-scheme: dark` → `light`, while `resolveTheme()` in `js/modules/theme.js` resolves stored value → `light` and `initTheme()` applies it unconditionally
  - [x] either share one fallback chain between both entry points or have `initTheme()` adopt the value already present on `<html data-theme>`
  - [x] confirm the toggle's `aria-pressed` and `aria-label` report the effective theme after load
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P1-01
  - **Completion condition:** with no `everafterring-theme` entry and a system dark preference, `<html data-theme>` stays `dark` after load and the toggle reports the dark state, matching the fallback documented in `README.md`
  - **Delivered:** `e5997f5`. The second resolution was removed by adoption rather than duplication: `resolveTheme()` in `js/modules/theme.js:34` is now `getStoredTheme() || getDocumentTheme() || "light"`, where `getDocumentTheme()` (`js/modules/theme.js:27-30`) reads and validates `<html data-theme>` — the value the bootstrap already wrote. `applyTheme()` routes through `updateToggle()` (`js/modules/theme.js:36-42`), so `aria-pressed` and `aria-label` are set from the effective theme. `js/theme-bootstrap.js:25-26` records the contract without changing its behaviour.

- [x] **PH2-02 — Make the closed state the mobile navigation default** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] author `[data-nav-panel]` in `partials/header.html` so it is closed by default at the mobile breakpoint
  - [x] correct the rule in `css/components/nav.css` where `.nav__panel:not([hidden])` resolves the base `translateX(-100%)` back to `translateX(0)`, making the open position the default below 1024 px
  - [x] reduce `initPanelState()` in `js/modules/nav.js` to managing ARIA state and the desktop case, so JavaScript is only required to open the panel
  - [x] verify the desktop breakpoint and the existing resize handling still expose the navigation correctly
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P1-02
  - **Completion condition:** a built page loaded at 375 px width with JavaScript disabled shows page content with no full-screen panel overlay, and with JavaScript enabled there is no open-panel frame before initialisation
  - **Delivered:** `c047695`. `partials/header.html:12` authors the panel with `hidden`; `.nav__panel:not([hidden])` is gone from both the mobile and the desktop selector list in `css/components/nav.css`, leaving `translateX(0)` to `[data-open="true"]` only, so the mobile default resolves to the base `translateX(-100%)`. `initPanelState()` (`js/modules/nav.js:24-32`) now only exposes the panel above the breakpoint and syncs `aria-expanded`. The desktop media query still neutralises `.nav__panel[hidden]`, and the resize, `Escape`, focus-trap and link-close paths (`js/modules/nav.js:36-102`) are unchanged.

- [x] **PH2-03 — Complete the project-notice dialog against its declared modality** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] route the existing `data-project-notice-close` backdrop in `partials/footer.html` to a defined close path, or remove the attribute so no dismiss affordance is implied
  - [x] add `Escape` handling to `js/modules/project-notice.js`
  - [x] reuse `trapFocus` from `js/utils.js` while the dialog is open, as `js/modules/nav.js` already does, and release it on close
  - [x] keep the existing focus restore to `previousFocus`
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P1-03
  - **Completion condition:** while the notice is open, `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` cycle only within the dialog, `Escape` closes it, and the backdrop either closes it or carries no close-intent attribute
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-01`
  - **Delivered:** `61506c3`. `js/modules/project-notice.js` opens through `trapFocus(dialog)`, binds a document `keydown` listener for `Escape`, and wires every `[data-project-notice-close]` host to the same close path; the close path releases the trap and the listener before restoring focus to `previousFocus` when that target is still connected and outside the notice. `trapFocus` in `js/utils.js` gained the programmatically focused-container case so `Tab` from the dialog itself enters the cycle instead of leaving it.

- [x] **PH2-04 — Derive the select indicator colour from a theme token** — **Priority:** High
  - [x] replace the hardcoded `%23f4e7d2` stroke in the inline SVG chevron in `css/components/forms.css` with a value derived from `css/tokens.css`, so it inverts with the theme
  - [x] establish what this actually removes from the component layer: it clears the last raw hex literal outside `css/tokens.css`, but not every raw colour value — the `rgb()`/`rgba()` shadow and backdrop tints in `css/components/buttons.css` and `css/components/project-notice.css` predate this task and are outside its scope
  - [x] check the indicator against `var(--color-surface)` in both themes
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P1-04
  - **Completion condition:** the dropdown indicator on both required `<select>` fields in `kontakt.html` is clearly distinguishable against the field background in `data-theme="light"` and `data-theme="dark"`
  - **Delivered:** `0e19ea8`. The data URI was dropped rather than recoloured — a data URI is a separate document and cannot read a custom property, so the chevron is now drawn as two `linear-gradient` strokes that consume `var(--color-text-muted)` directly (`css/components/forms.css:71-99`). The indicator therefore inverts with `data-theme` on its own. Against `var(--color-surface)` the pair resolves to `#6f6864` on `#ffffff` in light and `#cbbbae` on `#241d1a` in dark — the token pairs already measured in `AUDIT.md` section 3 at 5.47:1 and 8.90:1, against the previous 1.22:1 in light.

## Phase 3 — Resilience and content integrity

**Goal:** Close the remaining source-visible risks and align the machine-readable disclosure with the project's stated demonstration character.

- [x] **PH3-01 — Guard storage access in the project-notice module** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] wrap the read and the write of `everafterringProjectNoticeAccepted` in `js/modules/project-notice.js` using the defensive pattern already established in `js/modules/theme.js` and `js/theme-bootstrap.js`
  - [x] ensure a storage failure cannot propagate out of the `onReady` callback in `js/app.js`
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P2-01
  - **Completion condition:** with site data blocked, the notice still renders, dismissal works for the current page, and no uncaught error is logged
  - **Depends on:** `PH2-03`
  - **Delivered:** `3a6da33`. `hasStoredAcceptance()` and `storeAcceptance()` (`js/modules/project-notice.js:7-21`) wrap both access points in `try`/`catch`; an unreadable store resolves to "not accepted" so the notice still renders, and the write is performed last in `closeNotice()` so dismissal, focus release and the scroll lock never depend on it.

- [x] **PH3-02 — Resolve the cookies table scroll-region contract** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] decide between giving the `role="region" tabindex="0"` wrapper in `cookies.html` the overflow behaviour its semantics promise, or removing the region and `tabindex`
  - [x] if the region is kept, add the missing `table`, `th`, `td` and overflow rules — no such rule exists anywhere under `css/` today — consistent with the existing component layer
  - [x] keep the change scoped to this one table, the only table in the project
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P2-02
  - **Completion condition:** at 360 px width the table content is reachable within its own region without horizontal page overflow, and the focus stop performs an actual scroll or is removed
  - **Delivered:** `589e5a9`. The region was kept and made real: `css/components/table.css` gives `.table-scroll` `overflow-x: auto` with a `:focus-visible` state, and styles `.table`, `th` and `td` in the component layer; `cookies.html:126-127` carries the `.table-scroll` and `.table` classes, and `css/main.css:13` imports the new file.

- [x] **PH3-03 — Resolve ownership of unreferenced assets** — **Priority:** Low
  - [x] decide per file whether to remove or document: `assets/svg/sun.svg`, `assets/svg/moon.svg`, `assets/svg/facebook.svg`, `assets/svg/x.svg`, `assets/svg/linkedin.svg`, `assets/svg/github.svg`, `assets/logo/logo.png`, `assets/placeholders/placeholder.jpg` — none is referenced from any HTML, CSS, JS, `assets/favicon/site.webmanifest`, or build script
  - [x] state which icon copy is authoritative, given that the theme and social icons also exist inline in `partials/header.html` and `partials/footer.html`
  - [x] record the decision in `README.md` if any file is retained
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P2-04
  - **Completion condition:** every file under `assets/` outside `img-src/` is either referenced from source or documented as intentionally retained
  - **Delivered:** All eight candidates were removed; none was retained, so no retention record was needed. The inline copy is authoritative for both icon sets: the six standalone SVGs carried path data byte-identical to the icons in `partials/header.html:41-54` and `partials/footer.html:44-78`, and the inline form is what the implementation requires — the theme toggle shows and hides its two icons through `css/components/nav.css:183-199`, and the social icons inherit `currentColor` from the footer link. `assets/logo/logo.png` was a 512×512 raster twin of the referenced `assets/logo/logo.svg`, with every raster size the project actually uses already provided by `assets/favicon/`; `assets/placeholders/placeholder.jpg` was a 1200×900 key visual superseded by the 1200×630 `assets/og-img/og-img.jpg` that every page's `og:image` and `twitter:image` point to, and no fallback path exists anywhere in the source that could consume it. `assets/svg/` and `assets/placeholders/` are gone, so the `README.md` structure trees no longer list them. Verified after removal: 383 local references across the pages, partials, CSS, and the manifest all resolve; `npm run build` passes both of its contract assertions; and the copied payload drops from 161 files (18 750 KB) to 153 (18 240 KB), with no `assets/svg`, `assets/placeholders`, `logo.png`, or `placeholder.jpg` anywhere in `dist/`.

- [x] **PH3-04 — Align structured data with the project's demonstration character** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] review the `LocalBusiness` JSON-LD block that all ten pages publish with real contact details, while the demonstration framing appears only in `partials/footer.html` and the legal pages
  - [x] bring the structured data into line with that framing — for example by relying on the `WebSite` block every page already carries, or by qualifying the business entity
  - [x] apply the decision consistently across all ten pages and keep `README.md`'s SEO section accurate
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — P2-06
  - **Completion condition:** no page publishes structured data asserting an operating business that the project's own documents state does not exist
  - **Delivered:** `4c51e29`. The `LocalBusiness` entity was dropped rather than qualified: all ten pages now publish a `WebPage` block linked by `isPartOf` to the shared `WebSite` block, whose `description` states the demonstration character and the fictional brand. No `LocalBusiness` markup and no telephone, email or postal address remain in any page's JSON-LD, and the structured-data section of `README.md` describes the new contract.

## Phase 4 — Documentation contracts

**Goal:** Keep the documented contracts accurate once the implementation changes land.

- [x] **PH4-01 — Synchronise `README.md` with the delivered implementation** — **Priority:** Medium
  - [x] update the build documentation, including the statement that the build was not run because `npm run build` overwrites versioned files in `assets/img/`, once `PH1-02` changes that contract — delivered with `PH1-02` in `85dc8e2`
  - [x] re-check the theme description ("przy braku zapisanego wyboru bierze pod uwagę `prefers-color-scheme`" / its EN counterpart) against the resolution unified in `PH2-01` — re-checked against the current source; the description matches the effective behaviour and needs no change
  - [x] re-check the accessibility section's claim about the project-notice modal against the behaviour delivered in `PH2-03`
  - [x] add `AUDIT.md` and `PLAN.md` to the project structure trees in both language sections, which currently list `CHANGELOG.md` and `LICENSE` only
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-02`, `PH2-01`, `PH2-03`
  - **Completion condition:** every mechanism described in `README.md` matches the current implementation, and the documented structure lists the tracked root documents
  - **Delivered:** The single accessibility bullet that described the notice as restoring the previous focus was replaced, in both language sections, by two bullets covering the dialog as `PH2-03` delivers it: `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` with the associated title and description, initial focus moved to the `tabindex="-1"` dialog container, `trapFocus` from `js/utils.js` held for the lifetime of the dialog, and a close path — `Escape`, the accept button, or the `[data-project-notice-close]` backdrop — that releases the trap and restores focus to the previously focused element when it is still connected and outside the notice. Every claim was read back from `js/modules/project-notice.js`, `js/utils.js` and `partials/footer.html` before being written; no behaviour was documented that the source does not implement. Both project structure trees now list `AUDIT.md` and `PLAN.md` alongside `CHANGELOG.md` and `LICENSE`, keeping the root documents in the alphabetical order the trees already used. The key-features entry for the modal was re-checked and left unchanged — its `role`, `aria-modal`, storage-key and focus-restore statements all still match the source.

- [x] **PH4-02 — Record completed changes in `CHANGELOG.md`** — **Priority:** Low
  - [x] add entries under `[Unreleased]` for the Phase 1–3 changes that meet the changelog significance standard
  - [x] keep pending plan items out of the changelog
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-02`, `PH2-04`, `PH3-04`
  - **Completion condition:** `CHANGELOG.md` describes the delivered changes and contains no entry for work that is still open in this plan
  - **Note:** `PH3-03` was the last Phase 1–3 item to land and now carries its own entry, so every completed Phase 1–3 change is recorded.

## Optional future improvements

These items sit outside the required Phase 1–4 remediation scope and were never part of it. None of them corrects a defect and none is required for the plan's completion, so an entry left unchecked here is a refinement that has not been picked up rather than outstanding remediation work. `O-01`, `O-02` and `O-03` have all since been delivered, so none is left unchecked.

- [x] **O-01 — Add a custom 404 page**
  - **Value:** an unknown path lands on a page consistent with the site's own design and navigation instead of the hosting platform's default, reusing the existing partial hosts and the `htmlPages` list in `scripts/html-shell.mjs`
  - **Scope boundary:** non-blocking; current behaviour is not a defect and hosting configuration is intentionally maintained outside this repository
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — section 7
  - **Delivered:** `9418eae`. `404.html` carries the same shared shell as every other page — the `data-partial` header and footer hosts, the synchronous `js/theme-bootstrap.js` tag and `css/main.css` — and `scripts/html-shell.mjs:22` adds it to `htmlPages`, the list `vite.config.js:183-186` uses directly as the Vite MPA entry set, so the production build resolves the partials into it and inlines the bootstrap exactly as it does for the other ten pages. Navigation is root-safe from any depth: `404.html:10` declares `<base href="/">`, because the hosting platform serves this one document for nested missing addresses as well, and `404.html:40-48` re-points the fragment-only skip link at the address actually being served so it stays a same-document jump instead of navigating to the site root. The page stays out of the index and out of discovery — `noindex, follow` at `404.html:16`, no canonical address of its own, and no entry in `sitemap.xml`, which still lists nine URLs. It is deliberately absent from `primaryNavPages` (`scripts/html-shell.mjs:26-33`) and owns no primary-navigation link, so the build's single-`aria-current` assertion neither applies to it nor is disturbed by it.

- [x] **O-02 — Reflect invalid form state in the accessibility tree**
  - **Value:** `aria-invalid` on the fields in `js/modules/form.js` would let screen readers announce a field as invalid on entry, rather than relying on the `aria-describedby` message alone; the attribute is currently absent from the repository
  - **Scope boundary:** non-blocking refinement to a working implementation; no change to the validation logic or the Netlify Forms contract
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — section 7
  - **Delivered:** The state travels the shared transition path the module already had rather than a second validity check: `showError()` sets `aria-invalid="true"` and `clearError()` removes it (`js/modules/form.js:4-25`), so every invalid branch of `validateField()` marks the field and every valid outcome clears it — the valid branch on `blur` and on submit, and the `input` handler that already cleared the message. No stale `aria-invalid="true"` can survive a field becoming valid, and repeated blur/submit/input cycles re-synchronise because each pass runs the same two functions. The attribute is written before the `aria-describedby` lookup can return early, so a validated field without a message target would still expose its state. Nothing else moved: the rules stay `field.validity`, the Polish messages, the described-by targets, the polite status region, the first-invalid-field focus, and the Netlify Forms markup (`name`, hidden `form-name`, honeypot, `method`, `action`, `data-netlify`) are unchanged, only the eight fields already carrying `data-validate` are touched — five inputs, two selects and the textarea, all of them `required` — while the optional `phone` field and the honeypot stay outside the validation contract. No CSS was added; the state carries no visual treatment of its own. Verified in Chromium against the built preview: `npm run build`, then `npx playwright test tests/form-validation.spec.js` — 1 passed. The new focused test asserts the observable contract only: after a submit with the required fields empty, the first validated field exposes `aria-invalid="true"`, holds focus, and computes its accessible description from the existing error target; filling it with a valid value clears both the state and the message.

- [x] **O-03 — Promote the build's consistency checks into a standalone check command**
  - **Value:** the partial-host and single-`aria-current` assertions in `scripts/html-shell.mjs` could run without writing any output, together with cheap additions such as local-reference resolution
  - **Scope boundary:** non-blocking; reuses logic that already exists and introduces no test framework or new dependency
  - **Source:** `AUDIT.md` — section 7
  - **Depends on:** `PH1-02`
  - **Delivered:** `scripts/check.mjs`, run by the new `npm run check` (`package.json:29`). The assertions were reused, not reimplemented: the checker imports `htmlPages`, `readSharedShell`, `readThemeBootstrap`, `resolveSharedShell` and `inlineThemeBootstrap` from `scripts/html-shell.mjs` and runs them in memory for all eleven pages, discarding every transformed document, so the required partial hosts (`scripts/html-shell.mjs:86-100`), the single-`aria-current` assertion (`scripts/html-shell.mjs:72-84`) and the synchronous theme-bootstrap tag (`scripts/html-shell.mjs:115-121`) keep exactly one implementation and the page list keeps exactly one registry. `scripts/html-shell.mjs` and `vite.config.js` were not touched, so the build contract is unchanged by construction. On top of the reused contracts the command resolves the local references the maintained source declares — `src`, `href`, `srcset` candidates, `data-partial-src` and the form `action` in the eleven pages and the two partials, `url()` and `@import` in the eighteen stylesheets under `css/`, and the icon, shortcut-icon and screenshot `src` entries in `assets/favicon/site.webmanifest`. Resolution follows whichever file owns the reference: page and partial references resolve from the project root, because the partials are fragments injected into root-level documents; stylesheet references resolve from the stylesheet that declares them; root-relative paths resolve from the project root; `srcset` candidates are checked one by one; query strings and fragments are stripped before the filesystem lookup; and `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `data:`, protocol-relative hosts, fragment-only links and the `<base href="/">` declaration in `404.html` are left alone, so no external address produces a false positive. Failures are collected rather than thrown one at a time, reported as `source file: problem` lines naming the unresolved reference, and the process exits `1`. Node built-ins only — no dependency was added, and `package-lock.json` is unchanged. Verified: `node --check scripts/check.mjs` passes; `npm run check` passes against the current repository, checking 390 local references across 11 pages, 2 partials, 18 stylesheets and the manifest with none unresolved; `dist/` was absent before the run and still absent after it, and running the command again against an existing build left all 168 files byte-identical in name, size and timestamp; `npm run build` still passes and still emits eleven pages carrying the resolved shell, exactly one `aria-current="page"` and the inlined bootstrap. Every failure path was exercised against a throwaway export of the tree rather than the working tree: a removed partial host, a removed bootstrap tag, a duplicated `aria-current`, a missing page file, a broken `src`, `srcset` candidate, `url()`, bare `@import` and manifest icon, malformed manifest JSON, and a reference escaping the project root each produced a named failure and a non-zero exit.
